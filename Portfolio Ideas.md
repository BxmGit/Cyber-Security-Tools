Cyber Security Professional Portfolio Ideas Brainstorm.

# Network Security

1. [**Port Scanner**](https://github.com/BxmGit/Professional-Cyber-Security-Portfolio/blob/main/Network%20Security/port_scanner.py)
2. [**Packet Capture**](https://github.com/BxmGit/Professional-Cyber-Security-Portfolio/blob/main/Network%20Security/traffic_capture.py)
3. Firewall Implementation
4. Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
5.  Analysis System
6. Network Hardening 
7. Network Segmentation with VLANS or Subnetting
8. SSH Hardening
9. Proxy servers and VPNS
10. Anomaly Detection with Machine Learning.
11. [**Network Topology and Live Host**](https://github.com/BxmGit/Professional-Cyber-Security-Portfolio/blob/main/Network%20Security/Network%20Topology%20and%20Host%20Detection.py) 
12. Packet Sniffers
13. Network Monitoring and Analysis: using a homelab and tools capture and analyse network traffic. Detect and Document anomailes, or simulate attacks like DDoS and monitor their signatures. 

# Web Security

1. Web Vulnerability Scanner
2. Secure Web Application
3. Web Application Security: Setup a vulnerabile web app. Indentify and exploit vulnerabilitys and then provide solutions. 


# End Point Security

1. Antivirus Software
2. USB Drive Security 


# Forensics

1. Digital Forensics Toolkit
2. Incedence Response Plan
3. Lost Data Retrieval
4. Conduct a digital forensics investigation.

# Cryptography

1. File Encryption / Decryption Tool
2. Secure Messaging Application

# Cloud Security
1. Secure AWS S3 Bucket or AZ bucket
2. Cloud Security Monitoring
3. Deploy a cloud-based application on platforms like azure or aws.
4. Document how you secured it.

# Ethical Hacking
1. Capture the Flag (CTF) Challenges. 
2. Keylogging
3. Vulnerability Assessment, using HTB or THM. 

# Misc
1. M-I-T-M attack simulation
2. WIFI Cracking
3. DDoS Attack Simulation and Mitigation 
4. Tool Comparison Technical Guide
5. SQL Injection
6. Incidence Response Simulation
7. Security Awareness Training Module: create a presentation. 
8. Host Based Intrusion Detection System: Deploy and configure a HIDS like OSSEC. Sim file tampering or unauthorised acces and show how the HIDS detects these. 
9. Write a set of security policies for a company. Such as Acceptable use, incidence response ect.
10. Scripting for automating tasks in cybersecurity. 

## Python Script ideas. 
- webscraper for CVES
- webscraper for OSINT
- Log analyzer: program that parses logs to identify suspicious activities and highlight and alert.
- Steganography tool: a script which can extract words from images.
- encryption and Decryption script.
- Automated Phishing Kit Detector
